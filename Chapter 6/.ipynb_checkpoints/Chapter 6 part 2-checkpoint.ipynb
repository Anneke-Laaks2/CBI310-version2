    "For chapter 7 to chapter 9 we will be working exclusively with continuous operation. It is important to fully understand the implications of steady state. Let's use the ethanol example from chapter 5, where the stoicheometric matrix was already set up. In this exercise you will be required to perform the calculations, although some pointers and answers will be given.\n",

    "Very important to understand that the liquid volume is not changing with time and that the **outlet concentration is the same as the concentration within the reactor**. When it comes to biological CSTRs (like all our examples) it is very important to realise that the microbial biomass in the reactor is responsible for all the reactions taking place. We thus need microbial biomass ($C_X$) for the reactor to work. Since the microbial biomass concentration in the reactor is the same as the microbial biomass concentration in the outlet, we are **constantly removing biomass from the reactor**. We typically don't add any microbial biomass in the feedstream and accordingly new microbial biomass has to grow to compensate for the lost biomass in the exit stream. At steady state the $C_X$ in the bioreactor will be constant, this implies that microbial biomass grows as fast it is removed from the reactor. Let's have a look at the equations again to see what this implies: "
